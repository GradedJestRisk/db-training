# Metamodel

Data about data, table about table.

## In SQL standard: information_schema

> The information schema consists of a set of views that contain information about the objects defined in the current database. The information schema is defined in the SQL standard and can therefore be expected to be portable and remain stable — unlike the system catalogs, which are specific to PostgreSQL and are modeled after implementation concerns. The information schema views do not, however, contain information about PostgreSQL-specific features; to inquire about those you need to query the system catalogs or other PostgreSQL-specific views.

All tables from `information_schema` schema [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/information-schema.html).

## PG-specific: system catalogs
