## WAL

### Automatic checkpointer configuration

> A checkpoint is begun every checkpoint_timeout seconds, or if max_wal_size is about to be exceeded, whichever comes first. The default settings are 5 minutes and 1 GB, respectively.

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-configuration.html

> Checkpoints are run periodically (the frequency of requested checkpoints is defined by checkpoint_timeout), and when they complete in time and the next one naturally begins itâ€™s considered a timed checkpoint. If checkpoints are calculating too slow or out of tune, they will be requested checkpoints.
