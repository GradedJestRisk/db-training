# WAL


[Dalibo](https://blog.dalibo.com/2024/01/05/cambouis.html)

## Automatic checkpointer configuration

> A checkpoint is begun every checkpoint_timeout seconds, or if max_wal_size is about to be exceeded, whichever comes first. The default settings are 5 minutes and 1 GB, respectively.

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-configuration.html

> Checkpoints are run periodically (the frequency of requested checkpoints is defined by checkpoint_timeout), and when they complete in time and the next one naturally begins itâ€™s considered a timed checkpoint. If checkpoints are calculating too slow or out of tune, they will be requested checkpoints.

## Manual checkpoint

Force checkpoint (WAL)
```postgresql
CHECKPOINT
```

## Checkpoint logs

## Table (stats)

Checkpointed
```postgresql
SELECT 
    buffers_checkpoint              buffer_checkpointed,
    checkpoints_timed timed_count,
    checkpoints_req   requested_count,
    TO_CHAR(stats_reset,'HH:MI:SS') stats_since,
    '=>',
    bg.*
FROM pg_stat_bgwriter bg
```

Reset stats
```postgresql
SELECT pg_stat_reset_shared('bgwriter') ;
```

## Database logs

```text

## Asychronous or synchronous commit

[Postgresql docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-async-commit.html)
> As described in the previous section, transaction commit is normally synchronous: the server waits for the transaction's WAL records to be flushed to permanent storage before returning a success indication to the client. The client is therefore guaranteed that a transaction reported to be committed will be preserved, even in the event of a server crash immediately after. 
> However, for short transactions this delay is a major component of the total transaction time. 
> Selecting asynchronous commit mode means that the server returns success as soon as the transaction is logically completed, before the WAL records it generated have actually made their way to disk. 

```text
synchronous_commit=off
```


## Disable WAL

[Postgresql docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html)
> `minimal` removes all logging except the information required to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown.
>  archive_mode cannot be enabled when wal_level is set to minimal.
 
```text
wal_level=minimal
```
