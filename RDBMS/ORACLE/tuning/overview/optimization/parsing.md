# Parsing

> To always have an efficient execution plan, you want to parse every SQL statement executed by the database engine. 
> But conversely, parsing is inherently a very expensive operation. 
> As a result, it must be minimized, and execution plans should be reused as much as possible â€” but not too much, though.
