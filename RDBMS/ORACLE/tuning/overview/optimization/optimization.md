[Chapter 11](sql-optimization.md) describes the available SQL optimization techniques, and goes on to explain how to choose between them. 

Chapter 12 describes how parsing works, how to identify parsing problems, and how to minimize parsingâ€™s impact without jeopardizing performance. 

Chapter 13 describes how to take advantage of available access structures in order to efficiently access data stored in a single table. 

Chapter 14 goes beyond accessing a single table by describing how to join data from several tables together. 

Chapter 15 deals with parallel processing and the techniques used for speeding up stream inserts, and for minimizing the interactions between components. 

Chapter 16 describes how physical storage parameters have an observable impact on performance.
